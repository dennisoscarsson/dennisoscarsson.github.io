    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summers day?</h1>
   
    <p>Shall I compare thee to a summers day? <br>
        Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate.</strong>  <br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date.</sup> </p>


<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed; <br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;</p>

<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, <br>
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, <br>
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. <br>
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, <br>
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
